# Swagger

Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. This helps to improvement communication between the Frontend and Backend development, giving the front end team a place to find API endpoints, and the backend a place to test them.

## Accessing Swagger
When the application is running (see [here](../README.md)), visit the following URL:
- [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger/)

## Modifying Swagger
In order to update the swagger document, you must update the [swager.yml](./swagger.yml) file. Documentation for swagger can be found [here](https://swagger.io/docs/).
